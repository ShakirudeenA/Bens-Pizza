Business Context & Objectives

I was commissioned by Benâ€™s Pizza, a fictional restaurant chain with branches in New York City and Philadelphia, to build a Power BI dashboard that would summarise their January sales performance.

This month held particular importance as it marked the launch of their newly shortened menu. A strategic move aimed to not only form a clearer brand identity, but to also improve operational efficiency. 


With these changes being trialed in their NYC and PHL branches, Ben's Pizza's management wanted a simple and effective way to assess the impact. They enlisted me to create a clear and accessible visual summary that could communicate the month's outcomes to staff and shareholders alike. 

Project Overview & Process

Used AI and python to generate a deliberately flawed dataset

Cleaned and Normalised data in MySQL

Imported Data into Power BI, ensuring correct table relationships

Created visuals that highlight key performance metrics across both Locations.


Reflections & Learnings

It was interesting experience to create a dashboard with a business's goals in mind. It made me factor in relevancy and significance, as it wasn't just about making aesthetically pleasing visuals, but creating ones that made sense in context. 


Though I generated the dataset, in hindsight it was more limited than I expected. This highlighted the importance of a well-rounded dataset, since the more data you collect, the broader and more valuable the insights you can deliver.
